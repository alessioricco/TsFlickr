some of the improvements I have to do:
Better messages in toasts and snackbar
remove the hamburger menu
the picture must be downloaded considering the screen size and the speed (3g,4g, wifi?)
attach a picture as email
test on different devices and speed
test, test, test everywhere
implement sorting
implement mail
improve the floating button animation and distance
add a better pull to refresh
add icons
the app works fine with a different orientation, but the thumbnails gallery must be improved
